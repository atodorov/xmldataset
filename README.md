XMLDataSet for Delphi and FreePascal

**Note:**
I have not been using or maintaining this project for 5+ years
because I'm no longer writing in Pascal.
This is an import of the original code base found at:
http://openfmi.net/projects/xmldataset

In the last year several people asked me about XMLDataSet so
I've moved it over to GitHub. If you'd like to become a maintainer
please let me know.
