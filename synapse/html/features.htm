<UL>
<LI>Synapse is not components, but only classes and routines. Not needed any installation! Just add unit to your uses.
<LI>Working under Windows and under Linux.
<LI>Can compile by Delphi, C++Builder, Kylix and FreePascal.
<LI>Support for communicating by dynamily loaded Winsock or Libc in blocking mode (or any other compatible library).
<LI>Supported is TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW protocols.
<LI>Limited support for non-blocking communication mode.
<LI>Can use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
<LI>Native full SOCKS5 proxy support for TCP and UDP protocols.
<LI>Native full SOCKS4/4a proxy support for TCP protocol.
<LI>Support for TCP through HTTP proxy tunnel.
<LI>Support for TCP with SSL/TLS by OpenSSL or SSLeay.
<LI>Support for TCP with SSL/TLS by StreamSecII.
<LI>Support for PING request by ICMP or ICMPv6.
<LI>Support for ASN.1 coding and decoding.
<LI>Support for DNS (TCP or UDP) with many non-standard records (include zone transfers).
<LI>Support for character code transcoding. Supported charsets are basic ISO codings (ISO-8859-x), windows codings (CP-125x), KOI8-R, CP-895 (Kamenicky), CP-852 (PC-Latin-2) and UNICODE (UCS-4, UCS-2, UTF-7 and UTF-8).
<LI>Support for character replacing during character set transforms. (i.e. for remove diakritics, etc.)
